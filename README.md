# 🔍 Machine Learning Regression Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor** models using Python and Scikit-learn. The objective is to compare the performance of these models on a given dataset and save the trained models for future use.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.11
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib / Pickle
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)


## 📊 Models Implemented

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Random Forest Regressor**

Each model is trained on the same dataset, and performance is evaluated using metrics like:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score
